This is a very simple Solr interface for Python.

If ``omdict`` is installed, you may use omdict instances for
parameters.  Otherwise, the parameters must be given as a dictionary
where the values may be either string values or a list of string
values.  This is a must for occasions where you use facets for several
fields for example.

Since the requests package still doesn't support multiple values for
parameter keys, we're better off using urllib3 for now, so that's what
I've chosen.
